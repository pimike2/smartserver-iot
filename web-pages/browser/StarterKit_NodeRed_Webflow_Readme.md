**SmartServer IoT StarterKit Dashboard (Fixed Datapoints)**
This flow is an example of a SmartServer IoT Starter Kit Dashboard Web page using Node-RED webflows. This flow uses fixed datapoints so you will need to re-assign all the datapoints once you import the flow into the CMS Sequence widget.

The Dashboard is made up of 3 groups which show up as three columns on the Dashboard Web page. The left hand group (group 1) uses a template node with a picture of the Starter kit. Group 2 and 3 use the normal dashboard nodes.  

The Starter Kit background image (group 1) has clickable buttons that control datapoints on the nearby devices, LEDs that represent the current state of some datapoints, and LED display that shows what you would see on the real device.  On the thermostat (lower-right hand corner of the image) you can switch the thermostat to use Celsius or Fahrenheit.  The thermostat Tstat Setpoint slider (lower-right) of group 2 can then be used to change the thermostat value in celsius or fahrenheit.
